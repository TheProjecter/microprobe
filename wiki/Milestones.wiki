#summary List the milestones to accomplish for the project

=== Pending ===

  * Complete the integration with the userinfuser tool.  After doing this, I would look into coming up with some basic Badges that students can earn based on some criteria.  The criteria is something I will also look into.

  * looking into expanding the User Profiles capability in the application to ensure users can specify the class + term they are associated with.  Using this information, I will look into filtering the data presented to the users when displaying the list of questions.

  * I want to work on a custom questions lists so that we can format the information we display along with the userinfuser information.
